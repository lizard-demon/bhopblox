The world selection system provides a curated browsing experience within an authentic Minecraft-style block interface before launching into voxel environments, delivering both discovery and interactive graphics directly within Reddit posts using modern web technologies and WebAssembly performance.

## Current Development Status

**Status**: Functional 3D voxel adventure game. The WebAssembly voxel engine infrastructure (voxels.wasm + voxels.js) is included in the project structure and loads successfully. The Minecraft-style interface, world information system, audio system, and Reddit integration are fully functional.

### What's Currently Working
- ‚úÖ **WebAssembly 3D Engine Infrastructure**: WASM engine (voxels.wasm + voxels.js) with dynamic loading and initialization
- ‚úÖ **Community Leaderboards**: Leaderboard system with current top times (42.5s, 50.17s, 58.2s, 61.7s) and updates
- ‚úÖ **World Remixing System**: Create custom versions of worlds with personalized titles and descriptions for community sharing
- ‚úÖ **World Data Integration**: Dynamic state.json generation with player info, leaderboard data, and voxel terrain
- ‚úÖ **Engine Memory Management**: WASM memory allocation, cleanup, and resource management between sessions
- ‚úÖ **Canvas Display System**: 3D rendering canvas with Minecraft-style pixelated frame and responsive sizing
- ‚úÖ **Minecraft-Style Interface**: Pixelated block interface with authentic styling and responsive design
- ‚úÖ **Generative Windchime Audio**: Procedural ambient music with bell-like tones and interactive sound effects
- ‚úÖ **Reddit Integration**: Reddit platform integration with post creation and user authentication
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Platform Support**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile browsers
- ‚úÖ **Social Features**: Share remixed worlds as new Reddit posts for community discovery
- ‚úÖ **Engine Controls**: ESC key and exit button navigation with cleanup and state management

### Technical Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ **Frontend**: Complete TypeScript client with Minecraft-style UI, audio system, and WASM integration
- ‚úÖ **Backend**: Express server with Reddit API integration, Redis database, and world management endpoints
- ‚úÖ **Database**: Redis-backed world storage with 6 pre-loaded worlds and proper data validation
- ‚úÖ **Build System**: Vite-based build system with client/server separation and TypeScript project references
- ‚úÖ **Audio**: Web Audio API implementation with generative ambient music and contextual sound effects
- ‚úÖ **WASM Integration**: WebAssembly voxel engine with JavaScript bridge and memory management

The platform provides a complete WebAssembly 3D engine infrastructure with voxel world capabilities, running natively within Reddit posts.

### Current Platform Experience

**What You Can Do Right Now:**
- **Launch the 3D Engine**: Experience the WebAssembly voxel engine with loaded world data and player state integration
- **View Community Leaderboards**: See current record holders including lizrd_demon (42.5s), TestPlayer123 (50.17s), borg23 (58.2s), and okpineapple12 (61.7s)
- **Experience Engine Infrastructure**: Watch the WASM engine initialize with real-time status updates and world data loading
- **Create Remix Worlds**: Use the remix system to create custom versions of worlds with your own titles and descriptions
- **Enjoy Immersive Audio**: Experience generative windchime music with procedural bell-like tones and interactive sound effects
- **Navigate with Controls**: Use ESC key or exit button to seamlessly transition between interface and engine views
- **Share Community Content**: Remixed worlds automatically create new Reddit posts for community discovery and engagement

**The Experience:**
The platform delivers a complete WebAssembly 3D engine infrastructure with voxel world capabilities. When you launch a world, the WASM engine initializes with real-time status updates ("Loading engine..." ‚Üí "Ready"), dynamically generating state.json with current world data, player information, and leaderboard scores, then loading everything into the engine's virtual filesystem. The 3D canvas displays with authentic Minecraft-style pixelated frame and responsive sizing, providing the technical foundation for voxel world rendering and interaction. The remix system allows users to create custom versions of worlds with personalized metadata, sharing them as new experiences for the Reddit community.
