3. **Personal Welcome**: The app will automatically greet you with your Reddit username (e.g., "Welcome [username]!")
4. **Enter the World**: Click the blue "Launch" button to start loading the 3D engine

### Simple Interface
The game features a streamlined interface with just two main states:

#### Menu State
- **Title**: Shows "Voxel World" or personalized greeting with your Reddit username
- **Launch Button**: Blue button to enter the 3D world
- **Status Display**: Shows current loading status ("Ready to play", "Loading...", "Ready!", or "Failed to load")

#### Game State  
- **Full-Screen Canvas**: The 3D voxel world takes up the entire view (90vw √ó 80vh with blue border)
- **Exit Button**: Red button positioned in top-right corner to return to the menu
- **Black Background**: Full-screen black background for immersive gaming experience

### Loading Process
1. **Engine Initialization**: Click "Launch" to start loading the voxel engine
2. **Status Updates**: Watch the status display for loading progress:
   - "Ready to play" (initial state)
   - "Loading..." (downloading WASM files and initializing engine)
   - "Ready!" (engine loaded successfully)
   - "Failed to load" (if engine fails to initialize)
3. **Automatic Transition**: Game canvas appears automatically when ready
4. **Button State**: Launch button is disabled during loading to prevent multiple attempts

The development server automatically creates a test subreddit where you can interact with the 3D voxel world in real-time.

### WASM Files

#### Pre-compiled Voxel Engine
The 3D voxel engine is pre-compiled and included in the project:
```bash
# WASM files are located in:
src/client/public/voxels.wasm  # Main voxel engine
src/client/public/voxels.js   # JavaScript loader and bridge
src/client/public/snoo.png    # Reddit mascot asset
src/client/public/default-icon.png  # App icon
```

### Development Workflow
1. **Client Development**: Edit files in `src/client/` - changes auto-rebuild
2. **Server Development**: Edit files in `src/server/` - API endpoints auto-reload
3. **Testing**: Use the Reddit playtest URL to test in real Reddit environment
