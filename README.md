### Current Gameplay Experience

**What You Can Do Right Now:**
- **Browse 6 Unique Voxel Worlds**: Explore detailed descriptions of Crystal Cave, Sky Islands, Ocean Mining, Volcano Base, Ice Palace, and Desert Oasis with author information and 3D exploration opportunities
- **Experience Authentic Minecraft Interface**: Enjoy complete block-style aesthetics with stone-textured panels, dirt/grass backgrounds, and pixelated rendering
- **Interactive World Selection**: Click to select worlds with visual feedback (bright green highlighting) and audio confirmation (ascending chord progressions)
- **Launch WebAssembly Voxel Engine**: Initialize the 3D voxel engine with real-time status updates and see the canvas display with authentic Minecraft-style block frame
- **View Community Leaderboard**: See current exploration scores including lizrd_demon (42.5 points), TestPlayer123 (50.17 points), borg23 (58.2 points), and okpineapple12 (61.7 points)
- **Immersive Windchime Audio**: Listen to generative windchime music with bell-like tones in higher registers using extended pentatonic scales, plus contextual sound effects for every interaction
- **Seamless Navigation**: Switch between world selection and engine states using ESC key or "‚óÄ EXIT" button with smooth transitions and proper cleanup

**The Experience:**
The game currently focuses on the voxel world browsing and selection experience within an authentic Minecraft-style interface. When you select and launch a world, the WebAssembly voxel engine initializes successfully with real-time status updates ("Loading engine..." ‚Üí "Ready"), automatically loading state.json data containing world data, player information, and community leaderboard directly into the Emscripten virtual filesystem. The engine displays a responsive 3D canvas (up to 1000x650px) with Minecraft-style block frame ready for immersive voxel world exploration. The emphasis is on the immersive block-themed atmosphere, 3D voxel exploration elements, sophisticated generative windchime audio system, and seamless Reddit integration.
