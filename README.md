- ‚úÖ **Frontend**: Complete TypeScript client with Minecraft-style UI, audio system, and WASM integration
- ‚úÖ **Backend**: Express server with Reddit API integration, Redis database, and world management endpoints
- ‚úÖ **Database**: Redis-backed world storage with 6 pre-loaded worlds and proper data validation
- ‚úÖ **Build System**: Vite-based build system with client/server separation and TypeScript project references
- ‚úÖ **Audio**: Web Audio API implementation with generative ambient music and contextual sound effects
- ‚úÖ **WASM Integration**: WebAssembly voxel engine with JavaScript bridge and memory management

The platform provides a complete WebAssembly 3D engine infrastructure with voxel world capabilities, running natively within Reddit posts.

### Current Platform Experience

**What You Can Do Right Now:**
- **Launch the 3D Engine**: Experience the WebAssembly voxel engine with loaded world data and player state integration
- **View Community Leaderboards**: See current record holders including lizrd_demon (42.5s), TestPlayer123 (50.17s), borg23 (58.2s), and okpineapple12 (61.7s)
- **Experience Engine Infrastructure**: Watch the WASM engine initialize with real-time status updates and world data loading
- **Create Remix Worlds**: Use the remix system to create custom versions of worlds with your own titles and descriptions
- **Enjoy Immersive Audio**: Experience generative windchime music with procedural bell-like tones and interactive sound effects
- **Navigate with Controls**: Use ESC key or exit button to seamlessly transition between interface and engine views
- **Share Community Content**: Remixed worlds automatically create new Reddit posts for community discovery and engagement

**The Experience:**
The platform delivers a complete WebAssembly 3D engine infrastructure with voxel world capabilities. When you launch a world, the WASM engine initializes with real-time status updates ("Loading engine..." ‚Üí "Ready"), dynamically generating state.json with current world data, player information, and leaderboard scores, then loading everything into the engine's virtual filesystem. The 3D canvas displays with authentic Minecraft-style pixelated frame and responsive sizing, providing the technical foundation for voxel world rendering and interaction. The remix system allows users to create custom versions of worlds with personalized metadata, sharing them as new experiences for the Reddit community.
