The development server automatically creates a test subreddit where you can interact with the 3D voxel world in real-time.

### WASM Files & World Database

#### Pre-compiled Voxel Engine
The 3D voxel engine is pre-compiled and included in the project:
```bash
# WASM files are located in:
src/client/public/voxels.wasm  # Main voxel engine
src/client/public/voxels.js   # JavaScript loader and bridge
src/client/public/snoo.png    # Reddit mascot asset
src/client/public/default-icon.png  # App icon
```

#### World Database Structure
The game includes a Redis-backed world database with 12 pre-loaded worlds:
```bash
# Redis data structure:
voxel_entries          # Sorted set for world ordering (by creation time)
entry:entry_1          # Hash map for each world's metadata
entry:entry_2          # Contains: id, title, description, createdAt, author
# ... (entry_1 through entry_12)
```

### Development Workflow
1. **Client Development**: Edit files in `src/client/` - changes auto-rebuild
2. **Server Development**: Edit files in `src/server/` - API endpoints auto-reload
3. **Testing**: Use the Reddit playtest URL to test in real Reddit environment
