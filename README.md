## Getting Started for Developers

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 22+ (required for Devvit platform compatibility)
- Modern browser with WebGL and WebAssembly support
- Reddit account for testing

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start development server
4. Visit the provided Reddit playtest URL (e.g., `https://www.reddit.com/r/bhopblox_dev?playtest=bhopblox`)

The development server automatically creates a test subreddit (`r/bhopblox_dev`) where you can interact with the 3D voxel world in real-time.

### WASM Development

#### Pre-compiled Voxel Engine
The 3D voxel engine is pre-compiled and included in the project:
```bash
# WASM files are located in:
src/client/public/voxels.wasm  # Main voxel engine with 3D graphics capabilities
src/client/public/voxels.js   # JavaScript loader and bridge
src/client/public/snoo.png    # Reddit mascot asset
```

#### Source Code
The voxel engine source code and build artifacts are available in:
```bash
bhopblox-wasm4/zig-source/     # Complete source project
bhopblox-wasm4/wasm/          # Compiled WASM artifacts
```

### Development Workflow
1. **Client Development**: Edit files in `src/client/` - changes auto-rebuild
2. **Server Development**: Edit files in `src/server/` - API endpoints auto-reload
3. **Testing**: Use the Reddit playtest URL to test in real Reddit environment
4. **WASM Updates**: Rebuild WASM modules if modifying engine code
