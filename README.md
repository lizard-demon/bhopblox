## Getting Started for Developers

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 22+ (required for WASM and Devvit compatibility)
- Zig compiler (for voxel engine development)
- Go 1.19+ (for WASM mathematical functions)

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies

4. Visit the provided Reddit playtest URL to test live

The development server automatically creates a test subreddit where you can interact with the 3D voxel world in real-time.

### WASM Development

#### Voxel Engine (Zig)
The 3D voxel engine is pre-compiled and included in the project:
```bash
# Pre-compiled WASM files are located in:
src/client/public/voxels.wasm  # Main voxel engine
src/client/public/voxels.js   # JavaScript loader
```

#### Additional WASM Modules (Go)
```bash
cd src/wasm
make
# Output: lib.wasm in src/client/public/
```
